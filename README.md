## Our process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   chartjs
-   coincap.io API
-   anychartjs
-   lottie

### What we learned

New learnings in code encapsulates the following:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
    console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

Chartjs has no native CandleStick chart so the use of anychartjs was required. Perhaps forking chartjs and creating a candlestick card for them will be really useful.
